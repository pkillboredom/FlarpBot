This work in progress discord bot is intended for use on one particular server. The code is free-as-in-beer but not free-as-in-puppy, I don't have free time to provide support. Any support given is no guarantee of future support.

The bot portion is based in part on [Discord-Bot-Csharp by VACEfron](https://github.com/VACEfron/Discord-Bot-Csharp). That project is distributed under the MIT license, as is this one.

This solution depends on:

- .NET 6
- ASP.NET Core 6
- Visual Studio 2022
- [Discord.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discord.Net/)
- [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/)
- A variety of Microsoft extension packages.
